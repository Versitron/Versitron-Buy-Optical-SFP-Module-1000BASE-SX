## What is an SFP Module?

An SFP (Small Form-factor Pluggable) module is a compact, hot-swappable fiber optic transceiver that converts electrical signals into optical signals for fiber optic communication. SFP modules are widely used in datacenter, enterprise, and telecom networks to provide high-speed, low-latency, and secure fiber connectivity. The 1000BASE-SX multimode SFP modules with LC connectors allow easy deployment of gigabit links across short to medium distances.
